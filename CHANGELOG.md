# Brunch 1.5.2 (January 13, 2013)
* Improved installation process.

# Brunch 1.5.1 (January 11, 2013)
* Tester no longer runs watcher by default.
* Changed `brunch test -f REGEX` option to `-g / --grep` for consistency with Mocha.

# Brunch 1.5.0 (January 2, 2013)
* Added ability to wrap files in sourceURLs which simplifies debugging a lot.
Disabled by default in non-production mode, but can be disabled with `config.modules.addSourceURLs = false`.
* Added `-f REGEX, --filter REGEX` option to `brunch test`.
* `--minify` (`-m`) command line option was changed to `--optimize` (`-o`).
The previous version is deprecated and will be removed in the future.
This is made for plugins that will do optimizations of you application
that are not minifications.
* `config.modules.wrapper` now accepts full file path as first argument,
instead of sanitized.
* Debugging mode syntax was changed to standardized
`DEBUG=brunch:* brunch <command>`.
* Fixed bug when process didnâ€™t returned code "1" on compilation errors.
* Brunch will now work only with brunch plugins that have
`brunch` in their name.
* Improved error handling of running brunch in non-brunch app dirs.

# Brunch 1.4.5 (December 14, 2012)
* Updated base brunch with chaplin skeleton to the latest libs.

# Brunch 1.4.4 (October 1, 2012)
* All errors are now deferred to the compilation end.
Also, if you have added one error on previous compilation
and one error on current, brunch will show both of them until
they will be fixed.
* Fixed terminal-notifier.app integration.
* Fixed test passing.
* Fixed `config.notifications` on ubuntu.

# Brunch 1.4.3 (September 2, 2012)
* Added support of binary files to generators.
* Improved error logging.
* Updated built-in webserver to express.js 3.0.

# Brunch 1.4.2 (August 18, 2012)
* Fixed incorrect scaffolding on windows.
* `.git` directories are now discarded when using `brunch new` with git URL.

# Brunch 1.4.1 (August 8, 2012)
* `brunch new` now allowed to take current working directory
(`.`) or any existing directory as first argument.
* Assets are now affected by `conventions.ignored` too.
* Fixed linting bug.

# Brunch 1.4.0 (August 4, 2012)
* Added new phenomenally simplified scaffolder:
    1. Create `generators/` directory in your brunch application
    (directory name is customizable by `config.paths.generators`).
    2. Create generator directory there with `generator.json` and
    files that will be generated.
* Added conventions:
    * Conventions are configurable via `config.conventions[name]`.
    Convention can be a RegExp or Function.
    * `assets` convention: all files in directories that named as `assets`
    (default value) will be copied to public path directly.
    * `vendor` All files in directories that named as `vendor`
    (default value) won't be wrapped in modules.
    * `tests` convention: all files that end with `_test.<extension>`
    (default value) are considered as test files and will be loaded
    automatically with `brunch test`.
    * `ignored` convention: all files that start with `_` (default value)
    are considered as partial files and won't be compiled. Useful for
    Stylus / Sass languages. This replaces functionality of
    `config.paths.ignored`.
* Added AMD support by allowing more flexibility with file wrapping:
    * `config.modules` can be an object of:
        * `config.modules.wrapper` - string, boolean or function,
        defines how to wrap files in app directory in modules.
        * `config.modules.definition` - string, boolean or function, defines
        what to add on top of every file.
* Added linting support. Linting is a static analysis of code. Example
tools for this are JSHint, CSSLint etc. The lint API is
`plugin.lint(data, path, callback)`. One file can use more than one linter.
* Added config option that disables growl / libnotify notifications.
Usage: `config.notifications = false`.
* Added support for Mac OS X Mountain Lion notification center.
You'll need to place
[terminal-notifier.app](https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier/downloads)
to `/Applications/` to get it work.
* Removed support for:
    * `config.files[lang].defaultExtension`.
    Brunch will automatically detect extension from your generator file name.
    * `config.framework`, `config.generators`. It's not needed because
    all generators are local to your application and because
    brunch now has `generators/` directory.
    * Array type of `paths.vendor` / `paths.assets`. They're replaced by
    conventions.
* If any error happened in `brunch build`,
it will exit with error code `1` instead of `0`.
* Fixed commonjs `require_definition` in <IE9.

# Brunch 1.3.4 (July 7, 2012)
* Fixed bug with too fast compilations.

# Brunch 1.3.3 (June 29, 2012)
* Added node.js 0.8 and 0.9 support.
* `jsdom`, required for `brunch test` can now be installed once
for all apps via `npm install -g jsdom`. You'll need to have its
parent dir in `NODE_MODULES` env variable.
* Fixed `compiled in` timer and `brunch generate` bugs.

# Brunch 1.3.2 (June 27, 2012)
* Fixed `brunch test` on new projects.

# Brunch 1.3.1 (June 22, 2012)
* Config can now be in any language you use in app (e.g. livescript).
* Added `--reporter` (`-r`) option to `brunch test` which allows to choose
Mocha reporter.
* Made require definition much easier for debugging.

# Brunch 1.3.0 (June 19, 2012)
* Brunch with Chaplin is now the default application skeleton, that will be
created on `brunch new <app>`. Old one is still available with
`brunch new <app> -s github://brunch/simple-coffee-skeleton`.
Chaplin is an awesome set of classes on top of Backbone.js that
makes making big webapps very simple.
* Added testing support (thanks to Andreas Gerstmayr):
    * [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/) is used as test engine.
    It's a feature-rich, flexible and fun.
    * `brunch test` (or `brunch t`) is used to run all tests in CLI env.
    * `test` directory is now watched. Add `'javascripts/tests.js': /^test/`
    to `config.javascripts.joinTo` in `config.coffee` to compile them.
* Improved command line API:
    * Added `github://user/repo` skeleton address schema support to `brunch new`.
    * Debug mode now has logger namespaces. Usage:
    `BRUNCH_DEBUG=<ns> brunch <command>` where `<ns>` is:
    `watcher`, `writer`, `*`.
* Improved file watcher:
    * Vim backup files are now ignored by watcher.
    * Fixed watching of non-compiled files in `app`.
* Improved config API:
    * Added support for `config.server.base`, which determines base URL
    from which to serve the app. The default value is empty string.
    * `config.paths.ignored` now doesn't need to check versus if
    file is `config.coffee` or `package.json`, it does it automatically
    in brunch code.
    * Fixed `config.paths.ignored` on windows.
    * `config.paths.vendor` is now an array, but it will be soon deprecated.
* Changed `onCompile` plugin API. Now it receives an array of
`fs_utils.GeneratedFile`. This makes it very rich and allows to build smarter
reloaders. For example, the ones that reload browser tabs only on stylesheet
change.
* Semicolon is now added after every compiled vendor library because of
some libs that break with brunch. Hello, Zepto!
* Styles in `vendor` directory are now sorted correctly, before `app` files.
* Only generated files that depend on changed in current compilation files
are written now. Before, brunch was writing all files each time.

# Brunch 1.2.2 (May 24, 2012)
* Brunch now outputs compilation time.
* Assets are copied one-by-one on change, instead of copying the whole
assets directory. This improves watcher performance by about 25%+.
* Disabled caching in built-in webserver.
* Improved `brunch generate`:
    * Added `--plural` option to `brunch generate`. Plural version of generator
    name is used in controllers and collections. By default, brunch does pluralizing
    instead of you.
    * Added `collection` generator to `brunch generate`. It is not included in
    `brunch g scaffold`, because it's not needed most of the time.
    * Added `collectionView` generator to `brunch generate` for Chaplin users.
    It doesn't generate corresponding `template`.
* If `package.json` or `config.coffee` were removed during the watching,
brunch process will exit.
* Maximum time between changes of two files that will be considered
as a one compilation changed from 100ms to 65ms.

# Brunch 1.2.1 (May 12, 2012)
* Fixed persistence of process with `brunch watch` (without server).
* Fixed watching of files on windows.

# Brunch 1.2.0 (May 12, 2012)
* Greatly improved `brunch generate`:
    * User can now define his own generators in `config.generators`.
    * Default generators are now:
        * `controllerTest`, `modelTest`, `viewTest`, `template`, `style`
        * `controller` (generates `controllerTest` too)
        * `model` (generates `modelTest` too)
        * `view` (generates `template`, `style` & `viewTest` too)
        * `scaffold` (generates `controller`, `model`, `view` and their generators)
* Improved config API:
    * Added `paths.ignored` param that redefines
    paths ignored by brunch.
    * `paths.assets` can now be an array of paths.
* Improved plugin API:
    * Added support for `onCompile` method.
    It allows to create great & simple live browser reloaders.
* Added pushState support to the built-in webserver.
* Files that end with two underscores (e.g. `a.js__`) are now ignored by
watcher and compiler because they're created by some IDEs.
* Files in `vendor` directory are now sorted correctly, before `app` files.

# Brunch 1.1.2 (April 20, 2012)
* Fixed `buildPath is deprecated` warning on new configs.
* Fixed compiling of invalid files (`.rb`, `.png` etc).

# Brunch 1.1.1 (April 19, 2012)
* Fixed compiling of `package.json`, `config` and watching of assets.
* Fixed incorrect date in brunch logger.
* Fixed an error when requiring custom server script.

# Brunch 1.1.0 (April 15, 2012)
* Added windows support.
* Added node.js 0.7 / 0.8 support.
* Added support for chain compilation. For example, if `_user.styl` changes
and `main.styl` depends on it, `main.styl` will be recompiled too.
* `brunch watch` now also watches config & `package.json`.
* Improved command line API:
    * Added optional `--config` param to all commands expect `brunch new`.
    Usage: `brunch build --config ios_config`.
    * Brought back `--minify` param in `brunch build` and `brunch watch`.
    * Deprecated `--output` param in `brunch build` and `brunch watch`.
    * Param `--template` in `brunch new` has been renamed to `--skeleton`.
    `--skeleton` supports relative / absolute path and git repo URLs.
    Also, git metadata is automatically removed in cloned / copied projects.
* Improved config API:
    * `buildPath` is now deprecated, `paths.public` is used instead of it.
    * Added `paths.app`, `paths.root`, `paths.assets`, `paths.test`,
    `paths.vendor`.
    * Scripts that are not in the config[lang].order are now compiled in
    alphabetical order instead of random.
    * Made optional presence of almost all config params.
* Improved module loader:
    * Real exceptions are now thrown instead of strings when module
    wasn't found.
    * Fixed an issue when loader cached same modules more than once.
    * Fixed an issue when loader loaded non-existing modules.
* Greatly improved default coffee skeleton architecture:
    * Moved all collections to `models`.
    * Replaced `routers` with `lib/router`.
    * No more global variable for application bootstrapper, it can be loaded
    with `require 'application'`.
    * Switched default templates to Handlebars. Handlebars.js is a nice
    mustache-compatible template engine that supports helpers
    (`lib/view_helper`).
* Fixed loading of non-coffeescript configs.
* Made optional existence of `app` & `vendor` directories.
* Node.js API now mirrors command line api.

# Brunch 1.0.3 (April 3, 2012)
* Dotfiles from assets dir are prevented to be copied to build dir.

# Brunch 1.0.2 (March 28, 2012)
* Removed `Cakefile` from default template.
* Changed recommended framework in `test/spec` to Mocha.

* Updated dependencies.
* Fixed permissions issue with `app/assets` folder.

# Brunch 1.0.0 (March 14, 2012)
* Simplified config files.
* Default app now uses two separate files to simplify debugging: `app.js` and
`vendor.js`.
* Changed default naming of build directory & its subdirs. Now the style
matches expressjs and rails.
    * `build` directory is now `public`.
    * `scripts` has been renamed to `javascripts`.
    * `styles` has been renamed to `stylesheets`.
* Rewritten API for plugins to be framework-agnostic & much more simple:
    * All `brunch-extensions` plugins have been split into separate repos.
    * Added support for generator templates.
    * Added support for different extensions in brunch generators.
    * Added support for including files with plugins.
* Improved command line API:
    * Added `--template` / `-t` option to `brunch new`.
    * Added `--path` `-p` option to `brunch generate`.
    * Added support for custom webservers to `brunch watch --server`.
* Files, whose names start with `_` and files in `app/assets` are now ignored
by compiler (but not by watcher).
* Update backbone to 0.9.1, underscore to 1.3.1 and jquery to 1.7.1.
* Added IcedCoffeeScript plugin.
* Fixed Jade templates. See
[jade-brunch](https://github.com/brunch/jade-brunch) for more info.

* Added debugging mode. You can enable it by prepending `BRUNCH_DEBUG=1 ` to
brunch command.

# Brunch 0.9.1 (February 21, 2012)
* Updated brunch-extensions to 0.2.2.

# Brunch 0.9.0 (January 10, 2012)
* Added new API for plugins.
* Added support for Jade, LESS and Roy. All language compilers / plugins are
now located in separate repo,
[brunch-extensions](https://github.com/brunch/brunch-extensions).
* Added JS & CSS minifier.
* CoffeeScript (instead of YAML) is now used for application configs.
* Improved file watcher speed by 5-fold.
* Implemented new directory structure:

    * All assets (index.html, images etc.) are placed in app/assets/.
    * `main.coffee` was renamed to `initialize.coffee` for clarity.
    * `src/vendor` and `src/app` moved to `vendor` and `app`.
    * All scripts from `src/vendor` are moved to `app/vendor/scripts`.
    * Added support for CoffeeScript in `vendor/scripts`.
    * Added support for Stylus / LESS in `vendor/styles`.
    * Templates have moved from `app/templates` to `app/views/templates`.
* Updated command line API:
    * `brunch build` and `brunch watch` now compile files in current working
    directory (instead of in `./brunch/` subdir).
    * Added `brunch generate` command. It's basically a shortcut for creating new
    model / view / router. Example usage: `brunch generate view user`.
    * Added `brunch watch --server` flag that would run http server on
    build directory. It has an optional `--port` setting.
* Added support for node 0.6.
