# Brunch 1.2.2 (unreleased)
* Disabled caching in built-in webserver.
* Added `--plural` option to `brunch generate`. Plural version of generator
name is used in controllers and collections. By default, brunch does pluralizing
instead of you.
* Added `collection` generator to `brunch generate`. It is not included in
`brunch g scaffold`, because it's not needed most of the time. Because it
works only with plural, it should be generated in singular form:
`brunch g collection user` instead of `brunch g collection users`.

# Brunch 1.2.1 (May 12, 2012)
* Fixed persistence of process with `brunch watch` (without server).
* Fixed watching of files on windows.

# Brunch 1.2.0 (May 12, 2012)
* Greatly improved `brunch generate`:
    * User can now define his own generators in `config.generators`.
    * Default generators are now:
        * `controllerTest`, `modelTest`, `viewTest`, `template`, `style`
        * `controller` (generates `controllerTest` too)
        * `model` (generates `modelTest` too)
        * `view` (generates `template`, `style` & `viewTest` too)
        * `scaffold` (generates `controller`, `model`, `view` and their generators)
* Improved config API:
    * Added `paths.ignored` param that redefines
    paths ignored by brunch.
    * `paths.assets` can now be an array of paths.
* Improved plugin API:
    * Added support for `onCompile` method.
    It allows to create great & simple live browser reloaders.
* Added pushState support to the built-in webserver.
* Files that end with two underscores (e.g. `a.js__`) are now ignored by
watcher and compiler because they're created by some IDEs.
* Files in `vendor` directory are now sorted correctly, before `app` files.

# Brunch 1.1.2 (April 20, 2012)
* Fixed `buildPath is deprecated` warning on new configs.
* Fixed compiling of invalid files (`.rb`, `.png` etc).

# Brunch 1.1.1 (April 19, 2012)
* Fixed compiling of `package.json`, `config` and watching of assets.
* Fixed incorrect date in brunch logger.
* Fixed an error when requiring custom server script.

# Brunch 1.1.0 (April 15, 2012)
* Added windows support.
* Added node.js 0.7 / 0.8 support.
* Added support for chain compilation. For example, if `_user.styl` changes
and `main.styl` depends on it, `main.styl` will be recompiled too.
* `brunch watch` now also watches config & `package.json`.
* Improved command line API:
    * Added optional `--config` param to all commands expect `brunch new`.
    Usage: `brunch build --config ios_config`.
    * Brought back `--minify` param in `brunch build` and `brunch watch`.
    * Deprecated `--output` param in `brunch build` and `brunch watch`.
    * Param `--template` in `brunch new` has been renamed to `--skeleton`.
    `--skeleton` supports relative / absolute path and git repo URLs.
    Also, git metadata is automatically removed in cloned / copied projects.
* Improved config API:
    * `buildPath` is now deprecated, `paths.public` is used instead of it.
    * Added `paths.app`, `paths.root`, `paths.assets`, `paths.test`,
    `paths.vendor`.
    * Scripts that are not in the config[lang].order are now compiled in
    alphabetical order instead of random.
    * Made optional presence of almost all config params.
* Improved module loader:
    * Real exceptions are now thrown instead of strings when module
    wasn't found.
    * Fixed an issue when loader cached same modules more than once.
    * Fixed an issue when loader loaded non-existing modules.
* Greatly improved default coffee skeleton architecture:
    * Moved all collections to `models`.
    * Replaced `routers` with `lib/router`.
    * No more global variable for application bootstrapper, it can be loaded
    with `require 'application'`.
    * Switched default templates to Handlebars. Handlebars.js is a nice
    mustache-compatible template engine that supports helpers
    (`lib/view_helper`).
* Fixed loading of non-coffeescript configs.
* Made optional existence of `app` & `vendor` directories.
* Node.js API now mirrors command line api.
