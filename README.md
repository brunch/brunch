> HTML5 applications made easy.

Fast front-end web app build tool with simple declarative config, seamless incremental compilation for rapid development, an opinionated pipeline and workflow, and core support for source maps

## First steps

Install Brunch with a simple node.js package manager command: `npm install -g brunch`

1. **Create** a new Brunch project: `brunch new [--skeleton url]`
    - skeleton specifies a skeleton from which your application will be initialized.
    The default skeleton (dead-simple) doesn't have any opinions about frameworks or libraries.
    - [brunch.io/skeletons](http://brunch.io/skeletons) contains over 50
    boilerplate projects, which you can use to init your app from.
2. **Develop** with Brunch: `brunch watch --server`
    - tells Brunch to watch your project and incrementally rebuild it when source files are changed.
    The optional server flag launches a simple web server with push state support.
    - If you use OS X and want brunch to show system notification every time compilation error happens, you will need to install terminal notifier:
    `brew install terminal-notifier`
3. **Deploy** with Brunch: `brunch build --production`
    - builds a project for distribution. By default it enables minification.
