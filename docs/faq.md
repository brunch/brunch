# FAQ

## I want to start new project with Brunch. What's the workflow?

* Create new project `brunch new <skeleton>`.
* Create static HTML pages in `app/assets` directory (`login.html`, `user.html` etc.) and corresponding styles in `app/styles`.
* Watch application files with `brunch watch --server` and see the results in browser on `localhost:3333`. Auto-debug in browser with `auto-reload-brunch` (`npm install --save auto-reload-brunch`) which will automatically re-apply styles or reload the page when changes are saved.
* When all mockups are done, create app classes for them with `scaffolt` ([scaffolt package](https://github.com/paulmillr/scaffolt)). E.g. `scaffolt view user` (you need to have `generators` directory in your app).
* Debug your code in browser via `console.log` or `debugger` statements.

## I don't like CoffeeScript. Does brunch work for pure js projects?

Yep, brunch is language-agnostic! Just create a project from [any JS skeleton](https://github.com/brunch/brunch/wiki/Skeletons) and customize it to your needs.

## How to use Bower?

Brunch supports [Bower](http://bower.io) package manager.

To add package to your project:

* Make sure you have `bower.json`, which can be generated by `bower init`
* Add packages to `dependencies` field of your `bower.json`
* Optionally specify [`overrides` property](https://github.com/paulmillr/read-components#read-components) for packages without `bower.json`

Example app with Bower integration: http://github.com/paulmillr/ostio

## I want to create a separate javascript file for a bookmarklet (etc.). What's the best way?

Use this joinTo config. It will compile all files in app/ (except in `app/namespace`) to one file and all files in `app/namespace` to another.

```coffeescript
joinTo:
  'javascripts/namespace.js': /^app(\/|\\)namespace/
  'javascripts/app.js': /^app(\/|\\)(?!namespace)/
  'javascripts/vendor.js': /^vendor/
```

## How do I uninstall old plugin and install new?

For example, you want to change default `Handlebars` templates to `eco`.

* Remove `"handlebars-brunch": "version"` line from `package.json`.
* Install eco-brunch: `npm install eco-brunch --save`.

## What version of plugin do I need to use?

You may saw that there are eco-brunch 1.0.1, 1.1.0 etc.

Brunch x.y.z releases are compatible with plugins (in this case `eco-brunch`) x.(<= y).*. It means that:

You can use:

* brunch 1.1.0 with plugin 1.0.0.
* brunch 1.1.0 with plugin 1.1.9.
* brunch 1.9.14 with plugin 1.5.6.

You may encounter problems if you use:

* brunch 1.1.0 with plugin 1.2.0.
* brunch 1.1.0 with plugin 2.0.0.
* brunch 2.0.0 with plugin 1.2.0.

## I get EMFILE error when I build Brunch project. WTF?

`EMFILE` means there are too many open files.
Brunch watches all your project files and it's usually a pretty big number.
You can fix this error with setting max opened file count to bigger number
with command `ulimit -n <number>` (10000 should be enough).

## How do I enable verbose mode for brunch commands?

*TL;DR*: Add a DEBUG environment variable, e.g. `DEBUG='brunch:*'`.
Then, when you run `brunch watch`, you'll see debug output.

###Linux/OS X:
`export DEBUG='brunch:*'`

Optionally, add this to your `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.

###Windows:
Add a System Environment variable via `Control Panel > System > Advanced System Settings (Advanced Tab) > Environment Variables`:
![Windows System Environment Variable](./windows.png?raw=true)

## I get error, like "MODULE_NOT_FOUND" when trying to run Brunch

You need to install brunch plugins. It can be done simply by executing `npm install` in your project directory.

## What languages do you recommend using?

* `CoffeeScript` is used because it plays nice with Backbone.js's object-oriented nature.
* `Stylus` is used because a) it has a customizable syntax (you can use or drop braces / semicolons / colons), unlike less / sass; b) its mixins are transparent. If you're writing `border-radius` in stylus with `nib`, it's automatically expanded to all needed vendor prefixes. No need to use `LESS` / `SCSS` syntax. Example: https://gist.github.com/2005644.
* `Handlebars` templates are used because they are logic-less, compatible with Mustache (which has implementations in many languages), and have a nice helpers system. If you're a fan of clear terse syntax, you might like `Jade` instead, which is similar to, but much clearer than `HAML`.
