Description
-----------

* `Cakefile` is a coffeescript makefile.
* `config.coffee` contains configuration of your app. You can set plugins / languages that would be used here.
* `app/assets` contains images / static files. Contents of the directory would be copied to `build/` without change.
* Other `app/` directories could contain files that would be compiled. Languages, that compile to JS (coffeescript, roy etc.) or js files and located in `app` are automatically wrapped in module closure so they can be loaded by `require('module/location')`.
* `build` is generated automatically, so you don't need to put anything there.
* `test/` contains feature & unit tests.
* `vendor` contains all third-party code. The code wouldn't be wrapped in modules, it would be loaded instantly instead.
