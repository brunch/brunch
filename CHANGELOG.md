  (no `joinTo` match)
* Improved handling of `plugins.on` and `plugins.off` when used with `overrides`
* New [config](https://github.com/brunch/brunch/blob/stable/docs/config.md) options
  * `server.command` for setting non-node.js custom server
  * Pass `server.config` settings to custom server
  * Create `absoluteUrl` option for source maps
  * Support for array of files in `pluginHelpers` config setting
* Build process now waits for [custom servers](https://github.com/brunch/brunch/blob/stable/docs/config.md#server) to call ```callback()```

# Brunch 1.7.14 (21 May 2014)
* [component](https://github.com/component/component) integration
* [anysort](https://github.com/es128/anysort)/[anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch)
  integration, providing much more flexible ways to define source files in
  config such as in `joinTo` and `order`
* [New config options](https://github.com/brunch/brunch/blob/stable/docs/config.md#plugins)
  to control which plugins are used (can be env-specific)
* Allow `onCompile` method to be defined in Brunch config file for triggering
  custom project-specific functionality after every compile cycle
* Default settings updates:
    * Ignore directories that start with underscore (to match filename handling)
    * Fix heroku issues

# Brunch 1.7.13 (9 December 2013)
* Fixed optimizers not actually optimizing the code.

# Brunch 1.7.12 (30 November 2013)
* Fixed syntax error in source code.

# Brunch 1.7.11 (29 November 2013)
* If you remove some file and create a file with the same name,
  it will be handled correctly.
* Linter warnings are now handled correctly.

# Brunch 1.7.10 (19 October 2013)
* Fixed optimizers.

# Brunch 1.7.9 (16 October 2013)
* Re-release of 1.7.8 because of npm code publishing bug.

# Brunch 1.7.8 (10 October 2013)
*NOTE:* Re-published on 16 October 2013 due to npm bug.
If installed prior to this date, it will actually run as if it is 1.7.6.
* Switched source maps format to new (`//#`).
  Old format is still available via `config.sourceMaps = 'old'`
* Assets dotfile ignore exception to enable copying of `.rewrite` files.

# Brunch 1.7.7 (28 September 2013)
*NOTE:* Re-published on 16 October 2013 due to npm bug.
If installed prior to this date, it will actually run as if it is 1.7.6.
* Fixed absolute paths exposal for plugin includes in source maps.
* Workers are now shut down on brunch re-watch.

# Brunch 1.7.6 (20 September 2013)
* Fixed overriding `config.files` in custom environments.
* Fixed issues with old compiler plugin versions.
* Adopted `brunch-config` as the standard config file name.
    * Config files named `config` still work, but will be deprecated starting
      with 1.8.

# Brunch 1.7.5 (17 September 2013)
* Added experimental workers support.
* Fixed custom enviroment bug.

# Brunch 1.7.4 (29 August 2013)
* Quick fix for `--optimize`d building.

# Brunch 1.7.3 (28 August 2013)
* Added `-e, --env` param to `build` and `watch`
  that will replace --config in 1.8.
  `env` is a dead-simple way of specifying your work environment.
  You can use `--env production` and then specify
  `config.overrides.production`, all properties of which will
  override default config. You may use more than one --env.
* Source maps for languages which don't support source maps
  (“identity source maps”) now generated from
  compiled source (js) instead of original source (coffee)
* Deprecated `--optimize` (use `--env production` or `--production`)
  and `--config` options.

# Brunch 1.7.2 (19 August 2013)
* Fixed windows issues with compilation.
* Auto-watching `bower.json` for changes now.
* Concatenate JS files in main property of bower component in valid order
  (how they were specified in `bower.json`).
* Respect config.order.before in brunch config for bower files.

# Brunch 1.7.1 (11 August 2013)
* Local brunch package now takes precedence over global and
  will be auto-loaded on global `brunch` command.
* Added `pluginHelpers` directive to `joinTo` configs. It allows to
  specify to which file you want stuff from plugins to be added
  (`handlebars-runtime.js`, for example).
* `.htaccess` is now properly copied from assets.
* Fixed issues on windows with copying many assets.

# Brunch 1.7.0 (23 July 2013)
* Added **source maps** support! Big thanks to
  [Pierre Lepers](https://github.com/plepers) and
  [Elan Shanker](https://github.com/es128).
* Added **Twitter Bower** package manager support.
  The support is very different from modern builders.
  You don’t need to specify concat order or list all files, brunch will do that
  for you automatically.
  **But**, some packages don’t specify which files they include and
  on which packages they depend.
  You may specify `overrides` property in root `bower.json`, see
  [read-components docs](http://github.com/paulmillr/read-components)
* Added proper **AMD support**. Just include almond.js with your AMD app
  and brunch will do require.js optimizer job for you.
* Added ability to use multiple compilator plugins for one file.
* Added `require.list` support to default require definition of app. This allows
  you to automatically load tests and stuff. See new [how-to-run-tests guide](https://github.com/brunch/brunch/blob/master/docs/faq.md#what-is-the-recommended-way-of-running-tests)
* Added `config.paths.watched` which replaces
  `config.paths.{app,test,vendor,assets}`.
* Added `config.modules.nameCleaner`, which allows you to set
  filterer function for module names, for example, change all
  definitions of app/file to file (as done by default).
* Added `config.fileListInterval` config prop that allows to set an
  interval in ms which determines how often brunch file list
  should be checked for new files (internal property).
* Added detailed messages of what was done to `compiled in` logs.
* Removed files are now actually removed from compiled output.
* Removed `config.modules.addSourceURLs` directive. Use source maps instead.
* Improved compilation performance.
* Improved error messages when there’s a need in `npm install`.
* Changed syntax of `brunch new` to `brunch new <uri> [dir]`
* Fixed advanced `conventions.assets` issues (e.g. `/styles\/img/`).

# Brunch 1.6.7 (8 May 2013)
* Fixed `brunch new --skeleton`.

# Brunch 1.6.6 (7 May 2013)
* Added `plugin#teardown` API support. With it you can stop servers in your
  plugins and stuff. It will be called after each brunch stop.
* Added `config.notificationsTitle`.
* Fixed double requiring of some plugins.
* Fixed reloading of `package.json` data.

# Brunch 1.6.5 (6 May 2013)
* Fixed `--config` option of build / watch commands.
* Fixed `watch` command description.

# Brunch 1.6.4 (5 May 2013)
* Don’t throw on missing devdependencies. Closes gh-541.
* Reload config correctly on change. Closes gh-540.

# Brunch 1.6.3 (7 April 2013)
* Fixed watching after `npm install`.
* `config.optimize` is taken into account if it was set manually.

# Brunch 1.6.2 (1 April 2013)
* Fixed watching of config files.

# Brunch 1.6.1 (25 March 2013)
* Fixed `brunch new`.

# Brunch 1.6.0 (24 March 2013)
* Removed `brunch generate` and `brunch destroy`.
  [scaffolt](https://github.com/paulmillr/scaffolt) is its simpler successor.
* Removed `brunch test`.
  [Mocha-phantomjs](http://metaskills.net/mocha-phantomjs/) is its simpler
  successor.

# Brunch 1.5.4 (19 March 2013)
* Fixed `brunch generate`, switched to standalone modules for some features.
* Added node 0.10 support.

# Brunch 1.5.3 (2 February 2013)
* When using `brunch generate`, generator will no longer overwrite
  existing files.
* Preserved context of `include` method of plugins.

# Brunch 1.5.2 (13 January 2013)
* Improved installation process.

# Brunch 1.5.1 (11 January 2013)
* Tester no longer runs watcher by default.
* Changed `brunch test -f REGEX` option to `-g / --grep` for consistency with
  Mocha.

# Brunch 1.5.0 (2 January 2013)
* Added ability to wrap files in sourceURLs which simplifies debugging a lot.
  Disabled by default in non-production mode, but can be disabled with
  `config.modules.addSourceURLs = false`.
* Added `-f REGEX, --filter REGEX` option to `brunch test`.
* `--minify` (`-m`) command line option was changed to `--optimize` (`-o`).
  The previous version is deprecated and will be removed in the future.
  This is made for plugins that will do optimizations of you application
  that are not minifications.
* `config.modules.wrapper` now accepts full file path as first argument, instead
  of sanitized.
* Debugging mode syntax was changed to standardized
  `DEBUG=brunch:* brunch <command>`.
* Fixed bug when process didn’t return code "1" on compilation errors.
* Brunch will now work only with brunch plugins that have `brunch` in their
  name.
* Improved error handling of running brunch in non-brunch app dirs.

# Brunch 1.4.5 (14 December 2012)
* Updated base brunch with chaplin skeleton to the latest libs.

# Brunch 1.4.4 (1 October 2012)
* All errors are now deferred to the compilation end.
  Also, if you have added one error on previous compilation and one error on
  current, brunch will show both of them until they will be fixed.
* Fixed terminal-notifier.app integration.
* Fixed test passing.
* Fixed `config.notifications` on ubuntu.

# Brunch 1.4.3 (2 September 2012)
* Added support of binary files to generators.
* Improved error logging.
* Updated built-in webserver to express.js 3.0.

# Brunch 1.4.2 (18 August 2012)
* Fixed incorrect scaffolding on windows.
* `.git` directories are now discarded when using `brunch new` with git URL.

# Brunch 1.4.1 (8 August 2012)
* `brunch new` now allowed to take current working directory (`.`) or any
  existing directory as first argument.
* Assets are now affected by `conventions.ignored` too.
* Fixed linting bug.

# Brunch 1.4.0 (4 August 2012)
* Added new phenomenally simplified scaffolder:
    1. Create `generators/` directory in your brunch application
       (directory name is customizable by `config.paths.generators`).
    2. Create generator directory there with `generator.json` and
       files that will be generated.
* Added conventions:
    * Conventions are configurable via `config.conventions[name]`.
      Convention can be a RegExp or Function.
    * `assets` convention: all files in directories that named as `assets`
      (default value) will be copied to public path directly.
    * `vendor` All files in directories that named as `vendor`
      (default value) won't be wrapped in modules.
    * `tests` convention: all files that end with `_test.<extension>`
      (default value) are considered as test files and will be loaded
      automatically with `brunch test`.
    * `ignored` convention: all files that start with `_` (default value)
      are considered as partial files and won't be compiled. Useful for
      Stylus / Sass languages. This replaces functionality of
      `config.paths.ignored`.
* Added AMD support by allowing more flexibility with file wrapping:
    * `config.modules` can be an object of:
        * `config.modules.wrapper` - string, boolean or function, defines how to
          wrap files in app directory in modules.
        * `config.modules.definition` - string, boolean or function, defines
          what to add on top of every file.
* Added linting support. Linting is a static analysis of code. Example
  tools for this are JSHint, CSSLint etc. The lint API is
  `plugin.lint(data, path, callback)`. One file can use more than one linter.
* Added config option that disables growl / libnotify notifications.
  Usage: `config.notifications = false`.
* Added support for Mac OS X Mountain Lion notification center.
  You'll need to place
  [terminal-notifier.app](https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier/downloads)
  to `/Applications/` to get it work.
* Removed support for:
    * `config.files[lang].defaultExtension`.
      Brunch will automatically detect extension from your generator file name.
    * `config.framework`, `config.generators`. It's not needed because all
      generators are local to your application and because brunch now has
      `generators/` directory.
    * Array type of `paths.vendor` / `paths.assets`. They're replaced by
      conventions.
* If any error happened in `brunch build`, it will exit with error code `1`
  instead of `0`.
* Fixed commonjs `require_definition` in <IE9.

# Brunch 1.3.4 (7 July 2012)
* Fixed bug with too fast compilations.

# Brunch 1.3.3 (29 June 2012)
* Added node.js 0.8 and 0.9 support.
* `jsdom`, required for `brunch test` can now be installed once for all apps via
  `npm install -g jsdom`. You'll need to have its parent dir in `NODE_MODULES`
  env variable.
* Fixed `compiled in` timer and `brunch generate` bugs.

# Brunch 1.3.2 (27 June 2012)
* Fixed `brunch test` on new projects.

# Brunch 1.3.1 (22 June 2012)
* Config can now be in any language you use in app (e.g. livescript).
* Added `--reporter` (`-r`) option to `brunch test` which allows to choose
  Mocha reporter.
* Made require definition much easier for debugging.

# Brunch 1.3.0 (19 June 2012)
* Brunch with Chaplin is now the default application skeleton, that will be
  created on `brunch new <app>`. Old one is still available with
  `brunch new <app> -s github://brunch/simple-coffee-skeleton`.
  Chaplin is an awesome set of classes on top of Backbone.js that makes making
  big webapps very simple.
* Added testing support (thanks to Andreas Gerstmayr):
    * [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/) is used as test engine.
      It's a feature-rich, flexible and fun.
    * `brunch test` (or `brunch t`) is used to run all tests in CLI env.
    * `test` directory is now watched. Add `'javascripts/tests.js': /^test/`
      to `config.javascripts.joinTo` in `config.coffee` to compile them.
* Improved command line API:
    * Added `github://user/repo` skeleton address schema support to
      `brunch new`.
    * Debug mode now has logger namespaces. Usage:
      `BRUNCH_DEBUG=<ns> brunch <command>` where `<ns>` is:
      `watcher`, `writer`, `*`.
* Improved file watcher:
    * Vim backup files are now ignored by watcher.
    * Fixed watching of non-compiled files in `app`.
* Improved config API:
    * Added support for `config.server.base`, which determines base URL from
      which to serve the app. The default value is empty string.
    * `config.paths.ignored` now doesn't need to check versus if file is
      `config.coffee` or `package.json`, it does it automatically in brunch
      code.
    * Fixed `config.paths.ignored` on windows.
    * `config.paths.vendor` is now an array, but it will be soon deprecated.
* Changed `onCompile` plugin API. Now it receives an array of
  `fs_utils.GeneratedFile`. This makes it very rich and allows to build smarter
  reloaders. For example, the ones that reload browser tabs only on stylesheet
  change.
* Semicolon is now added after every compiled vendor library because of some
  libs that break with brunch. Hello, Zepto!
* Styles in `vendor` directory are now sorted correctly, before `app` files.
* Only generated files that depend on changed in current compilation files are
  written now. Before, brunch was writing all files each time.

# Brunch 1.2.2 (24 May 2012)
* Brunch now outputs compilation time.
* Assets are copied one-by-one on change, instead of copying the whole assets
  directory. This improves watcher performance by about 25%+.
* Disabled caching in built-in webserver.
* Improved `brunch generate`:
    * Added `--plural` option to `brunch generate`. Plural version of generator
      name is used in controllers and collections. By default, brunch does
      pluralizing instead of you.
    * Added `collection` generator to `brunch generate`. It is not included in
      `brunch g scaffold`, because it's not needed most of the time.
    * Added `collectionView` generator to `brunch generate` for Chaplin users.
      It doesn't generate corresponding `template`.
* If `package.json` or `config.coffee` were removed during the watching, brunch
  process will exit.
* Maximum time between changes of two files that will be considered as a one
  compilation changed from 100ms to 65ms.

# Brunch 1.2.1 (12 May 2012)
* Fixed persistence of process with `brunch watch` (without server).
* Fixed watching of files on windows.

# Brunch 1.2.0 (12 May 2012)
* Greatly improved `brunch generate`:
    * User can now define his own generators in `config.generators`.
    * Default generators are now:
        * `controllerTest`, `modelTest`, `viewTest`, `template`, `style`
        * `controller` (generates `controllerTest` too)
        * `model` (generates `modelTest` too)
        * `view` (generates `template`, `style` & `viewTest` too)
        * `scaffold` (generates `controller`, `model`, `view` and their
          generators)
* Improved config API:
    * Added `paths.ignored` param that redefines paths ignored by brunch.
    * `paths.assets` can now be an array of paths.
* Improved plugin API:
    * Added support for `onCompile` method.
      It allows great & simple live browser reloaders.
* Added pushState support to the built-in webserver.
* Files that end with two underscores (e.g. `a.js__`) are now ignored by
  watcher and compiler because they're created by some IDEs.
* Files in `vendor` directory are now sorted correctly, before `app` files.

# Brunch 1.1.2 (20 April 2012)
* Fixed `buildPath is deprecated` warning on new configs.
* Fixed compiling of invalid files (`.rb`, `.png` etc).

# Brunch 1.1.1 (19 April 2012)
* Fixed compiling of `package.json`, `config` and watching of assets.
* Fixed incorrect date in brunch logger.
* Fixed an error when requiring custom server script.

# Brunch 1.1.0 (15 April 2012)
* Added windows support.
* Added node.js 0.7 / 0.8 support.
* Added support for chain compilation. For example, if `_user.styl` changes and
  `main.styl` depends on it, `main.styl` will be recompiled too.
* `brunch watch` now also watches config & `package.json`.
* Improved command line API:
    * Added optional `--config` param to all commands expect `brunch new`.
      Usage: `brunch build --config ios_config`.
    * Brought back `--minify` param in `brunch build` and `brunch watch`.
    * Deprecated `--output` param in `brunch build` and `brunch watch`.
    * Param `--template` in `brunch new` has been renamed to `--skeleton`.
      `--skeleton` supports relative / absolute path and git repo URLs.
      Also, git metadata is automatically removed in cloned / copied projects.
* Improved config API:
    * `buildPath` is now deprecated, `paths.public` is used instead of it.
    * Added `paths.app`, `paths.root`, `paths.assets`, `paths.test`,
      `paths.vendor`.
    * Scripts that are not in the config[lang].order are now compiled in
      alphabetical order instead of random.
    * Made optional presence of almost all config params.
* Improved module loader:
    * Real exceptions are now thrown instead of strings when module wasn't
      found.
    * Fixed an issue when loader cached same modules more than once.
    * Fixed an issue when loader loaded non-existing modules.
* Greatly improved default coffee skeleton architecture:
    * Moved all collections to `models`.
    * Replaced `routers` with `lib/router`.
    * No more global variable for application bootstrapper, it can be loaded
      with `require 'application'`.
    * Switched default templates to Handlebars. Handlebars.js is a nice
      mustache-compatible template engine that supports helpers
      (`lib/view_helper`).
* Fixed loading of non-coffeescript configs.
* Made optional existence of `app` & `vendor` directories.
* Node.js API now mirrors command line api.

# Brunch 1.0.3 (3 April 2012)
* Dotfiles from assets dir are prevented to be copied to build dir.

# Brunch 1.0.2 (28 March 2012)
* Removed `Cakefile` from default template.
* Changed recommended framework in `test/spec` to Mocha.

# Brunch 1.0.1 (26 March 2012)
* Updated dependencies.
* Fixed permissions issue with `app/assets` folder.

# Brunch 1.0.0 (14 March 2012)
* Simplified config files.
* Default app now uses two separate files to simplify debugging: `app.js` and
  `vendor.js`.
* Changed default naming of build directory & its subdirs. Now the style matches
  expressjs and rails.
    * `build` directory is now `public`.
    * `scripts` has been renamed to `javascripts`.
    * `styles` has been renamed to `stylesheets`.
* Rewritten API for plugins to be framework-agnostic & much more simple:
    * All `brunch-extensions` plugins have been split into separate repos.
    * Added support for generator templates.
    * Added support for different extensions in brunch generators.
    * Added support for including files with plugins.
* Improved command line API:
    * Added `--template` / `-t` option to `brunch new`.
    * Added `--path` `-p` option to `brunch generate`.
    * Added support for custom webservers to `brunch watch --server`.
* Files, whose names start with `_` and files in `app/assets` are now ignored by
  compiler (but not by watcher).
* Update backbone to 0.9.1, underscore to 1.3.1 and jquery to 1.7.1.
* Added IcedCoffeeScript plugin.
* Fixed Jade templates. See [jade-brunch](https://github.com/brunch/jade-brunch)
  for more info.
* Added support for javascript config files.
* Added debugging mode. You can enable it by prepending `BRUNCH_DEBUG=1 ` to
  brunch command.

# Brunch 0.9.1 (21 February 2012)
* Updated brunch-extensions to 0.2.2.

# Brunch 0.9.0 (10 January 2012)
* Added new API for plugins.
* Added support for Jade, LESS and Roy. All language compilers / plugins are now
  located in separate repo,
  [brunch-extensions](https://github.com/brunch/brunch-extensions).
* Added JS & CSS minifier.
* CoffeeScript (instead of YAML) is now used for application configs.
* Improved file watcher speed by 5-fold.
* Implemented new directory structure:
    * The build directory is now generated automatically.
    * All assets (index.html, images etc.) are placed in app/assets/.
    * `main.coffee` was renamed to `initialize.coffee` for clarity.
    * `src/vendor` and `src/app` moved to `vendor` and `app`.
    * All scripts from `src/vendor` are moved to `app/vendor/scripts`.
    * Added support for CoffeeScript in `vendor/scripts`.
    * Added support for Stylus / LESS in `vendor/styles`.
    * Templates have moved from `app/templates` to `app/views/templates`.
* Updated command line API:
    * `brunch build` and `brunch watch` now compile files in current working
      directory (instead of in `./brunch/` subdir).
    * Added `brunch generate` command. It's basically a shortcut for creating
      new model / view / router. Example usage: `brunch generate view user`.
    * Added `brunch watch --server` flag that would run http server on build
      directory. It has an optional `--port` setting.
* Added support for node 0.6.
* Added growl support.
* Changed reset.styl to normalize.css & helpers.css from html5boilerplate.
* Improvements for vendor data: support CSS in vendor/styles directory,
  support CoffeeScript (in addition to js) in vendor/scripts directory.
* Add firebug support to stylus compiler.
* Improved time formatting in console logs.
