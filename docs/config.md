# Configuration file

Brunch uses configuration file (`config.coffee` or `config.js`) located in the root directory to control various aspects of your application.

You can see all config default values in `setConfigDefaults` function of `src/helpers.coffee` in brunch source code.

You can also import node.js modules in configuration file.

## `paths`

`Object`: `paths` contains application paths to key directories. Paths are simple strings.

* `public` key: path to build directory that would contain output.
* `watched` key: list of all watched paths by brunch. Default:
  `['app', 'test', 'vendor']`

Example:

```coffeescript
paths:
  public: '/user/www/deploy'
```

## `files`

`Required, object`: `files` configures handling of application files: which compiler would be used on which file, what name should output file have etc.

* <type>: `javascripts`, `stylesheets` or `templates`
    * joinTo: (required) describes how files will be compiled & joined together. Available formats:
        * 'outputFilePath'
        * map of ('outputFilePath': /regExp that matches input path/)
        * map of ('outputFilePath': function that takes input path)
    * order: (optional) defines compilation order. `vendor` files will be compiled before other ones even if they are not present here.
        * before: list of files that will be loaded before other files
        * after: list of files that will be loaded after other files
    * pluginHelpers: (optional) specify which output file plugins' include files concatenate into. Defaults to the output file that `vendor` files are being joined to, the first one with `vendor` in its name/path, or just the first output file listed in your joinTo object.

All files from `vendor` directory are automatically (by-default) loaded before all files from `app` directory. So, `vendor/scripts/jquery.js` would be loaded before `app/script.js` even if order config is empty.

Example:

```coffeescript
files:
  javascripts:
    joinTo:
      'javascripts/app.js': /^app/
      'javascripts/vendor.js': /^vendor/
    order:
      before: [
        'vendor/scripts/console-helper.js',
        'vendor/scripts/jquery-1.7.0.js',
        'vendor/scripts/underscore-1.3.1.js',
        'vendor/scripts/backbone-0.9.0.js'
      ]
    pluginHelpers: 'javascript/vendor.js'

  stylesheets:
    joinTo: 'stylesheets/app.css'
    order:
      before: ['vendor/styles/normalize.css']
      after: ['vendor/styles/helpers.css']

  templates:
    joinTo: 'javascripts/app.js'
```

## `conventions`


`Object`: `conventions` define tests, against which all file pathnames will be checked.

* `ignored` key: regExp or function. Will check against files that would be ignored by brunch compilator, but that still be watched by watcher. For example, when you have `common.styl` file that you import in every stylus file, `common.styl` will be compiled on its own too which will result in duplicated code. When prefixing it with underscore (`_common.styl`) you are still able to import it in dependent files, but it won’t be compiled twice. The feature is very similar to Sass partials: http://wiseheartdesign.com/articles/2010/01/22/structuring-a-sass-project/. Implementation of default value (a function that checks if filename starts with `_`):

    ```coffeescript
    # Import node.js `path` module.
    sysPath = require 'path'

    # A simple helper that checks if string starts with substring.
    startsWith = (string, substring) ->
      string.lastIndexOf(substring, 0) is 0

    # Extract file name (`c.js` for `a/b/c.js`), check if it starts with `_`.
    conventions.ignored = (path) ->
      startsWith sysPath.basename(path), '_'
    ```

* `assets` key: regExp or function. Default value: `/assets(\/|\\)/`. If test gives true, file won't be compiled and will be just moved to public directory instead.
* `vendor` key: regExp or function. Default value: `/vendor(\/|\\)/`. If test gives true, file won't be wrapped in module, if there are any.

Keep in mind that default brunch regexps, as you see, consider **all** `vendor/` (etc.) directories as vendor (etc.) files. So, `app/views/vendor/thing/chaplin_view.coffee` will be treated as vendor file.

Example:

```coffeescript
conventions:
  ignored: -> false       # no ignored files
  assets: /files(\/|\\)/  # vendor/jquery/files/jq.img
```

## `modules`


`Object`: consists of `wrapper` and `definition` subsettings.

`modules.wrapper`: `String, Boolean or Function`: a wrapper that will be wrapped around compiled-to-javascript code in non-vendor directories. Values:

* `commonjs` (Default) — CommonJS wrapper.
* `amd` — AMD `r.js`-like wrapper.
* `false` — no wrapping. Files will be compiled as-is.
* Function that takes path and data

`modules.definition`: `String, Boolean or Function` a code that will be added on top of every generated JavaScript file. Values:

* `commonjs` (Default) — CommonJS require definition.
* `amd`, `false` — no definition.
* Function that takes path and data

Example:

  ```coffeescript
    # To use AMD, just add this and add require.js as
    # your first vendor file.
    modules:
      wrapper: 'amd'
      definition: 'amd'

    # Same as 'commonjs'.
    modules:
      wrapper: (path, data) ->
        """
    require.define({#{path}: function(exports, require, module) {
      #{data}
    }});\n\n
        """
  ```

## `nameCleaner`
`Function`: Allows you to set filterer function for module names,
for example, change all app/file to file. Example:

```coffeescript
# Default behaviour.
config:
  modules:
    nameCleaner: (path) ->
      path.replace(/^app\//, '')
```

## `notifications`


`Boolean`: enables or disables Growl / inotify / `terminal-notifier.app <https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier#download>`_ (OS X Mountain Lion +) notifications. Default value is `true` (enabled).

## `optimize`


`Boolean`: determines if minifiers should be enabled or not. Default value is `false` (`true` if you run `brunch build --optimize`).

## `server`


`Object`: contains params of webserver that runs on `brunch watch --server`.

* `path`: (optional) path to nodejs file that will be loaded. The file must contain `exports.startServer` function:

    ```coffeescript
    exports.startServer = (port, path, callback) ->
      # callback doesn't take any parameters and (if provided) should be called after server is started
      # should return an instance of http.Server
    ```

* `port`: (optional) port on which server will run
* `base`: (optional) base URL from which to serve the app

Example:

```coffeescript
server:
  path: 'server.coffee'
  port: 6832
  base: '/myapp'
```

## `sourceMaps`


`Boolean`: enables or disables Source Map generation. Default value is `true` (enabled).

## `fileListInterval`

`Number`: Allows to set an interval in ms which determines how often brunch file list
should be checked for new files (internal and usually not needed prop).

## `overrides`

`Object`: Alternate config settings to activate via command line switches (`--apply SETTING`)

Defaults:

```coffeescript
overrides:
  production:
    optimize: true
    sourceMaps: false
    plugins: autoReload: enabled: false
  optimize:
    optimize: true
```
